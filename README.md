for clarity and good data cleaning the gender columns was replace and from M to Male, F to Female
I also convert the date to a pandas datetime for easier timeseries analysis.
Looking across the data, we need to add day and month to corresponding our sales for the day and month to know
specific day and month with high sales.
from our analysis the <h4><b>Total sales : $51279.0<b></h4>
The Total sales by Gender shows us that females are the frequent customers at Fenty Beauty

with Product categories ranging from Lipstick, Lipgloss, Concealer, Foundation, Highlighter, to Contour.
which shows that Highlighter has the highest sales with over 14k unit sold, Foundation came seconf with over 12k unit solds, and the lowest been Contour with 4k unit sold shows that it is the least patronize.

I deduce the top selling product is Match Stix Contour Skinstick under the category of Contour which is lowest in revenue due to low price of the product.

This lead to month with the highest revenue and discovered that March due to cold nature of the weather which allows for makeup to last longer when apply to the face.
with both New York and Los Angelos both dominating the city with higest revenue .
